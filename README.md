#Fundraising Emails
 This repository collects and posts fundraising emails sent by major party candidates during the 2020 elections.

# Reading Fundraising Emails

## Miscellaneous Notes, Coverage Errors, etc.

- Marco Rubio's campaign opt-in did not sign us up for campaign emails, and instead connected us to constituent services emails.

# Joining to ICPSR IDs, Information about candidate, etc.

# Text Cleaning

Translating plain text characters to unicode text (and vice versa) meant that our text-processing frequently returned gibberish instead of a punctuation mark. Before cleaning and recoding text files, we note several points.

- Our ability to clean text easily varied across party, likely because candidates used different (related to partisanship) software to process emails.
